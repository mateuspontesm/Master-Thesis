% \indent\indent 5G systems are expected to deploy massive MIMO antennas and operate with millimeter waves. %
% With more antennas and wider bandwidth, \ac{CQI} estimation and reporting will be computationally demanding and \ac{RRA} might become hugely complex. %
% Furthermore, due to higher propagation losses in millimeter waves, system's reliability might become an issue. %
% In this context, the present thesis analyzes two strategies to address both problems: complexity and reliability. %
%
% The first strategy is to exploit the reduction of channel fluctuations due to the use of narrow beams with large antenna arrays, i.e., the channel “hardens”. %
% When this phenomenon happens, upper layer functions related to measurements can be optimized. %

%
% %The first strategy is to assume that the use of narrow beams with large antenna arrays in the transmitter reduces channel fluctuations, i.e., the channel “hardens”. %
% %Based on this assumption, upper layer functions related to measurements can be optimized. %
%
% The second strategy concerns the adoption of a tight integration between 5G NR and LTE. %
% More precisely, the \acp{UE} would be allowed to be simultaneously connected to both \acp{RAT}, the so-called \ac{DC}. %
%
% Before addressing these two strategies, we present an overview of the main 5G features used in this thesis and standardized in \ac{3GPP} specification release~$15$. %

% %Then, we investigate these concepts from the perspective of \ac{RRA}. %
% %Before addressing these topics, we present an overview of the main \ac{5G} features used in this thesis and specified in \ac{3GPP} specification release~$15$. %
%
% More specifically, frameworks related to \ac{CQI} measurement and reporting based on \ac{CH} occurrence are proposed. %
% Besides, we also propose procedures for base station selection and resource assignment in a multi-\ac{RAT} multi-connectivity system. %
% Numerical analyses considering 5G system parameters are presented validating the proposed methods and showing that they improve system performance. %

% %A tight interworking between the next generation of wireless cellular networks, the \acs{5G}, and legacy standards, e.g., \ac{LTE}, is being envisioned in order to support a wide range of service requirements. %
% %Aiming at addressing the challenge of coordinating resources across different technologies, centralized processing units are being considered. %
% %However, they have practical issues, e.g., processing costs and increased signaling overhead. %
% %In this context, the present work formulates an optimization problem in order to manage resources in a multi-\ac{RAT} scenario. %
% %Its objective is to maximize the minimum user throughput in the system subject to the constraint that for each user, his throughput must be higher than a requirement. %
% %One of the differences from previous works is that the users may connect to more than one \ac{RAT} at the same time, the so-called \ac{DC}. %
% %The referred problem is non-linear and hard to solve. %
% %However, we get to transform it into a simpler form, a \ac{MILP}, that can be optimally solved using standard optimization methods. %
% %This solution is categorized as a centralized solution. %
% %Thus, we propose a distributed framework to overcome the drawbacks of centralized processing. %
% %This framework is divided into two parts: a \ac{BS} selection procedure (performed by the users) and a resource assignment algorithm (performed by the \acp{BS}). %
% %Besides, a performance evaluation is conducted, considering 4G \ac{LTE} and \ac{5G} \ac{NR} parameters. %
%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% %Multi-beam operation is one of the key \ac{NR} features. %
% %In order to support it, the use of \ac{CSI-RS} was broadened and new synchronization signals were introduced, as the so-called \acp{SSB}. %
% %
% %Since these signals might depend on the transmitted beam, the size and amount of \ac{UE} measurements and reports may increase with the number of beams. %
% %Therefore, the complexity of \ac{RRA} and \ac{UE} mobility management may also increase, since they rely on accurate channel quality estimation. %
% %
% %An envisioned optimization is to consider that channel variations due to fast fading may decrease when the number of antennas increases and in the presence of beamforming. %
% %This phenomenon is described in the literature as the \ac{CH} effect. %
% %
% %Based on what was presented, this work proposes a method to identify when \ac{CH} is occurring and also optimization procedures in time and frequency domains that take into account the occurrence of \ac{CH}. %
% %
% %More specifically, the studied time domain optimization is related to cell quality measurements. %
% %We proposed a framework for \ac{CH} detection and L1 measurement optimization, where the \ac{CH} is detected based on the standard deviation of \ac{RSRP} measurements in a sliding window and the measurement periodicity is dynamically adjusted according to the level of \ac{CH}. %
% %
% %Concerning the frequency domain optimization, we proposed a framework focused on reducing the amount and size of \ac{CSI} reports. %
% %Its main idea is to group sub-bands with similar \ac{CQI} due to \ac{CH} and to send just one \ac{CQI} report for this entire set. %
% %It was also proposed that, if the \ac{UE} identifies that \ac{CH} is happening in a given period of time, then this \ac{UE} is allowed to measure some of these sub-bands with longer periodicity. %
% %
% %Computational simulations validated the proposed methods. %
% %The numerical results also showed that the \ac{UE} mobility negatively impacts the \ac{CH}, i.e., increasing the \ac{UE} speed increases channel fluctuations for some \acp{UE}. %
% %Despite of this, the proposed methods still work. %
