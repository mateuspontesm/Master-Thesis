\chapter{\Acl{la}} \label{chp:la}

In this chapter we analyze the performance of different \gls{rl} architectures for the selection of the \gls{mcs} and the precoder, which in turn decides the transmission rank.
%
These solutions are compared to a baseline solution that seeks the precoder that maximizes the mean \gls{snr}.

\section{System Model}
\label{sec:la-system-model}
% \subsection{Signal Model}

Consider a single cell system whose \gls{bs} is equipped with \gls{not:txAnt} antennas serving one user equipped with \gls{not:rxAnt} antennas.
%
In contrast to the previous chapter, here we assume a transmission mode with a multilayer scheme, where the \gls{bs} uses a precoder \gls{not:Wtx} \inSetComplex{\gls{not:txAnt}}{\gls{not:nLayers}} to transmit data over  \gls{not:nLayers} layers, while the \ue~applies a \gls{mmse} filter \gls{not:Wrx} \inSetComplex{\gls{not:nLayers}}{\gls{not:rxAnt}}.
%
The discrete received signal model at the receiver is represented as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.:rx_signal}
\gls{not:Y} =
\gls{not:Wrx}
\channel
\gls{not:Wtx}
\gls{not:sscl}
% _\userIdx
+
\gls{not:Wrx}
\gls{not:Z} \;,
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\channel $ \inSetComplex{\gls{not:rxAnt}}{\gls{not:txAnt}} represents the channel between the \base~ and the \ue, $\gls{not:sscl}$ represents the transmitted symbols at each layer to the \ue, and \gls{not:Z} is the Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance \gls{not:var}.
%
The filter \gls{not:Wrx} is calculated from the channel perceived by the receiver, $\channel_{\textrm{rx}} = \channel \gls{not:Wtx}$, as:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq.:Wrx}
\gls{not:Wrx} =
\left(
\channel_{\textrm{rx}}^H
\channel_{\textrm{rx}}
+
\frac{ \gls{not:var} }{ p_{\gls{not:sscl}} }
\mathbf{I}_{\gls{not:nLayers}} \right)^\dagger
\channel_{\textrm{rx}}^H \;,
\end{equation}

\noindent where the operator $\dagger$ represents the Moore-Penrose inverse, $\mathbf{ I}_{\gls{not:nLayers}} $ is the $\gls{not:nLayers} \times \gls{not:nLayers}$ identity matrix and $p_{\gls{not:sscl}}$ is the the power of the transmitted signal \gls{not:sscl}.
%
We define the \gls{snr} of the stream $i$ as:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.:snr}
\textrm{SNR}_i = \frac{ \abs{
		% \hermitian{\gls{not:Wrx}\subArg{\userIdx}\argPair{:}{\idxI}}
		\channel_{\textrm{eq}} (i,i)
		% \subArg{\userIdx} \gls{not:Wtx}\subArg{\userIdx}\argPair{:}{\idxJ}
	}^2 }{\gls{not:var}_{eq}} p_{\gls{not:sscl}} \; ,
\end{equation}
%
where $\channel_{\textrm{eq}} = \gls{not:Wrx} \channel \gls{not:Wtx}$ and the $\gls{not:var}_{\textrm{eq}}$ is given by:
%
\begin{equation}
\gls{not:var}_{\textrm{eq}} = \frac{
	\Tr \,  (\abs{ \gls{not:Wrx}^H \gls{not:Wrx} } )}
{\gls{not:rxAnt}}
\gls{not:var} \;.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Channel Description}


The model in \eqref{eq.:rx_signal} assumes a narrowband block-fading channel, so the channel is almost constant within a time-frequency resource block \cite{alkhateeb2014}.
%
We assume a geometric channel model with a limited number \gls{not:scatterers} of scatterers.
%
Each scatterer contributes with a single path between \gls{bs} and \gls{ue}. Therefore, the channel model can be expressed as
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq.:channelModel}
\channel = \sqrt{\pathloss}\sum_{k=0}^{\gls{not:scatterers} - 1 }\gls{not:beta}_k \strRx \anglePair{k}{UE} \hermitian{\strTx  \anglePair{k}{\textrm{UE}}},
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\pathloss$ denotes the pathloss, \gls{not:beta} is the complex gain of the $k$th path.
%
The azimuth \azm~$\in$ \range{0}{2\pi} and the elevation \elev~$\in$ \range{0}{\pi} are the \gls{aod} and \gls{aoa} at the \base~and \ue , respectively.
%
We assume a \glspl{ura} at the \gls{bs} and \gls{ue}. There are $\gls{not:txAnt}_{v}$ vertical antenna elements and  $\gls{not:txAnt}_{h}$ horizontal antennas elements, such that $\gls{not:txAnt} = \gls{not:txAnt}_{v} \gls{not:txAnt}_{h}$. The array response at the \gls{bs} is expressed as
%
% \begin{dmath}
% 	\strTx \anglePair{k} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gls{not:txAnt}}}\left[1, \ldots ,\expUraPhase{(\gls{not:txAnt} -1 )}{k} \right],
% \end{dmath}
% where \dist ~is the antenna element spacing, and \wave~is the signal wavelength. The array response at \gls{ue} can be written similarly.
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\strTx \anglePair{k}{BS} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\gls{not:txAnt}}}\left[1, \ldots , e^{\jmath  \left( (\gls{not:txAnt}_{v} - 1)\frac{2\pi \Delta}{\lambda} (\cos{\elev_{k}^{\textrm{\tiny{(BS)}}}}) + (\gls{not:txAnt}_{h} - 1)\frac{2\pi \Delta}{\lambda}\left (\sin{\azm_{k}^{ \textrm{\tiny{(BS)}} }} \sin{\elev_{k}^{\textrm{\tiny{(BS)}} }} \right)   \right)}  \right]^{T},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta$ ~is the antenna element spacing, and \wave~is the signal wavelength. The array response at \gls{ue} can be written similarly.

The \gls{mimo} channel in \eqref{eq.:channelModel} can be expressed compactly as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.:channelModelMtx}
\channel  = \strRxMtx \diag{\gls{not:betaVec}} \hermitian{\strTxMtx},
\end{equation}
where $\gls{not:betaVec} = \left[ \gls{not:beta}_0, \ldots, \gls{not:beta}_{\gls{not:scatterers}-1} \right]$, and the matrices \strRxMtx~and \strTxMtx~are formed by the concatenation \gls{ue} and \gls{bs} array response vectors, respectively.

\subsection{Transmission Model}

% The transmission process takes into account the channel coding, modulation, layer mapping and multi-antenna precoding blocks of Figure \ref{fig:transmission}.
%
In this work, we implement \gls{phy}/\gls{mac} layer as specified in \cite{3gpp.38.212} as explained in Chapter \ref{chp:theory} and depicted in Figure \ref{fig:transmission}.
%
%In this study we implemented all the steps specified in the channel coding block.
%
The \gls{tbs} calculation, the \glspl{mcs} tables and the multi-antenna precoding matrices, \gls{not:Wtx}, follow the specifications in \cite{3gpp.38.214}.
%


% The \gls{ue} reports the measured \gls{cqi} to the \gls{bs}, which decides the \gls{mcs} and \gls{pmi} accordingly.
The \gls{cqi} plays an important role to properly select the \gls{mcs}, while the \gls{pmi} helps the \gls{bs} in the selection of the multi-antenna precoder matrix.
%
The \gls{mcs} and \gls{ri} are informed to the \gls{ue} through the \gls{pdcch} as a part of the \gls{dci}.
%
This process is shown in Figure \ref{fig:la-system-model}.


The \gls{cqi} is a measure of the \gls{snr}, and the number of possible \gls{cqi}s is defined by $n_{cqis}$. We define the \gls{cqi} as:
% \begin{equation}\label{eq:cqi}
%     CQI =
%     \begin{cases}
%     0, \text{if } SNR \leq SNR_{min}\\
%     (N_{cqi}-1), \text{if } SNR \geq SNR_{max}\\
%     \floor[\Big]{\frac{(SNR - SNR_{min})(n_{cqis}-1)}{SNR_{max}-SNR_{min}}},
%     \end{cases}
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cqi}
\textrm{CQI} = \min{
	(\max {(0, \textrm{CQI}^{\prime} ) }, n_{\text{cqis}} - 1)},
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $\textrm{CQI}^{\prime}$ is calculated from the \gls{snr}s in dB as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cqi_prime}
\textrm{CQI}^{\prime} = \floor[\Big]{(n_{\text{cqis}}-1)\frac{\textrm{SNR} - \textrm{SNR}_{\text{min}}}{\textrm{SNR}_{\text{max}}-\textrm{SNR}_{\text{min}}}}
\end{equation}


The \gls{ri} indicates the transmission rank, number of layers, that the \gls{ue} deems the most suitable.
%
We calculate the \gls{ri} from the channel matrix \channel~, assuming full knowledge of it, as:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:la-rank}
    \textrm{\gls{ri}} = \textrm{rank} (\channel)
\end{equation}

% \noindent note that each \gls{cqi}, except the minimum and the maximum, comprises \gls{snr} intervals having the same length in dB.
% , since the \gls{snr} inside the range $[snr_{min},snr_{max}]$ is divided equally into \gls{cqi}s in this calculation.

At each \gls{tti}, the \gls{bs} calculates the \gls{tbs}, taking into account the selected \gls{mcs} and the number of spatial layers, and transmits a \gls{tb} with \gls{tbs} bits at the chosen \gls{mcs} and using the selected multi-antenna precoding matrix.
%
The \gls{ue} receives a \gls{tb} from the \gls{bs} and, in possession of the chosen \gls{mcs}, decodes the \gls{tb} and calculates its \gls{crc}, giving the \gls{bs} a \gls{acknack} that is further used to calculate the \gls{tbler} and the throughput.
%
The \gls{tbler} is the ratio of incorrectly received \gls{tb}s over the total number of transmitted \gls{tb}s.

% 	\caption{Exchange of signals referent to the link adaptation}
% 	\label{fig:la-system-model}
% \end{figure}
%

As explained in Chapter \ref{chp:theory}, usually the \gls{ue} indicates the preferred precoder by means of the \gls{pmi}, as indicated in Figure \ref{fig:la-system-model-1}.
%
Due to the nature of our proposed solution, the \gls{pmi} information can be eliminated from the \gls{csi} report, as showed in Figures \ref{fig:la-system-model-2} and \ref{fig:la-system-model-3}.
%
We also analyze the effect of the \gls{ri} report by the \gls{ue} to our solution.
%
Therewith, Figure \ref{fig:la-system-model} shows the exchange of signals involved in these three architectures, the standard exchange and the \gls{rl} with and without the report of the \gls{ri} by the \gls{ue}.

\section{Proposed QL-LA Solution}
\label{sec:la-proposed}

The proposed solution is a Q-learning based \gls{la} scheme, herein referred to as \gls{ql-la}.
%
The \gls{rl} based solution enables the system to learn the particularities of the environment and adapt to it.
%
In this work, we analyzed two different architectures, a multi-agent and centralized single agent, and also analyzed the influence of the \gls{ri} in the learning:

\subsection{Single Agent}
\label{subsec:single-agent}

In this architecture, the \gls{bs} uses one agent to select the pair of precoder and \gls{mcs} to be used at each time step.
%
The selection is based on the Q-learning algorithm and its state-action pair.
%
Since only the precoders defined in \cite{3gpp.38.214} are being considered, each precoder can be designated from its \gls{pmi}, hence the choice of the precoder is the same as the choice of the \gls{pmi}.
%
Figure \ref{fig:la-rl-frame-sa} shows the proposed single agent solution.


\begin{figure}[!hb]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=0.7\columnwidth]{figures/chp_la/rl-framework-mateus_sa.png}}
	\caption{Basic diagram of the proposed single agent LA scheme}
	\label{fig:la-rl-frame-sa}
\end{figure}

In the proposed centralized \gls{la} solution, it is evaluated two state spaces:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The set of all possible \gls{cqi}s, from $0$ to $(n_{\text{cqi}}-1)$, for both agents;
    \item The set of all the combinations of \glspl{cqi} and \glspl{ri}.
\end{enumerate}
%
The action space is the set of all possible combinations of \glspl{mcs} and precoders, \glspl{pmi}.
%
As for the reward, $R$ is defined as:

\begin{equation}\label{eq.:la-reward-sa}
    R = \begin{cases}
    \textrm{\gls{tbs}}, \text{ if ACK} \\
    0, \text{ else,}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Since this centralized Q-table can have a large size when the number of layers increase, another architecture is proposed to mitigate this problem, a multi-agent architecture.

\subsection{Multi-Agent}

In this architecture, the \gls{bs} uses two \gls{rl} agents, one to select the \gls{mcs} and another to select the precoder.
%
The agents are asynchronous, since they work do not work simultaneously.
%
Both selections are based on the state-action mapping obtained from the two Q-learning algorithms.


% The choice of using two agents in the \gls{bs} is due to the large action space if a single agent chooses both the \gls{mcs} and \gls{pmi}, hence a multi-agent approach leads to a faster learning since less samples are required to fill up the Q-tables.
The use of two agents is motivated by the reduced computational complexity to compute the action-state space.
%
While using a single agent requires a large Q-table to construct all the possible \gls{mcs} and precoder combinations, multiple agents solve the problem separately by computing two smaller Q-tables.
%
As explained in Section \ref{subsec:single-agent}, each precoder can be designated from its \gls{pmi}, then the precoder agent is called \gls{pmi} agent.
% More specifically, the \gls{bs} chooses the \gls{mcs} and the \gls{pmi} using the Q-tables obtained from the \gls{rl} algorithms.
%
Figure \ref{fig:la-rl-frame} shows how the \gls{rl} framework fits the \gls{la} problem.

% A diagram adapting the model from Figure \ref{fig:rlbasic} to the \gls{la} problem is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rl-frame}.
%
\begin{figure}[!hb]
	\centerline{\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{figures/chp_la/rl-framework-mateus.png}}
	\caption{Basic diagram of the proposed multi-agent LA scheme}
	\label{fig:la-rl-frame}
\end{figure}
%


In the proposed \gls{la} solution, it is evaluated two state spaces:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The set of all possible \gls{cqi}s, from $0$ to $(n_{\text{cqi}}-1)$, for both agents;
    \item The set of possible \glspl{cqi} for the \gls{mcs} agent and the set of all the combinations of \glspl{cqi} and \glspl{ri}.
\end{enumerate}
%
The action space is the set of all possible \gls{mcs}s for the agent 1 and the set of all possible \gls{pmi}s for the agent 2.
%
The \gls{mcs} agent works at each time interval, i.e at each transmission, while the \gls{pmi} agent works after 10 iterations of the \gls{mcs} agent.
%
They work at different time windows to avoid a misunderstanding of the reward, since both depend on the \gls{acknack}.
%
As for the reward for each agent, $R_{PMI}$ is defined as:
%
\begin{equation}\label{eq.:rewardPMI}
R_{\text{PMI}} = \sum_{\textrm{i}=\textrm{t}-9}^\textrm{t} \left( 1- e_{\text{nack}}^\textrm{i} \right) \gls{not:nLayers}
\end{equation}
%
\noindent where $e_{\text{nack}}^\textrm{i}$ is the error indicator of the transmission $\textrm{i}$ and \gls{not:nLayers} is the number of transmission layers, the time index $\textrm{i}$ in $gls{not:nLayers}_\textrm{i}$ can be suppressed, because for each $\textrm{i}$ in that time window the number of layers and the precoder remains constant.
%
The $R_{\text{MCS}}$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq.:rewardMCS}
R_{MCS} = \begin{cases}
\dfrac{\textrm{\gls{tbs}}}{\gls{not:nLayers}}, \text{ if ACK} \\
0, \text{ else,}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
\noindent where \gls{tbs} is the number of transmitted information bits and is defined in terms of \gls{not:nLayers} as shown in \cite{3gpp.38.214}.
%
The division of \gls{tbs} by \gls{not:nLayers} in Eq. \eqref{eq.:rewardMCS} is used to make the reward of the \gls{mcs} agent more independent from the \gls{pmi} choice.
% The \gls{tbs} calculation is defined in \cite{3gpp.38.214} and it is dependent of the \gls{not:nLayers}, hence the division is used to make the reward of the \gls{mcs} agent more independent from the \gls{pmi} choice.

\section{Simulations and Results}
\label{sec:la-simulation}
\subsection{Simulation Parameters}
We assess the system performance with one \gls{bs} that serves one \gls{ue}.
%
The system has a bandwidth $B$ with a frequency carrier of $28$ GHz.
%
Each resource block has a total of $12$ subcarriers and a subcarrier spacing $\gls{not:sub-spacing} = 120 \text{KHz}$ .
%
A \gls{nr} frame is composed by 10 subframes, and each one consists of multiple slots, where each slot has 14 symbols.
%
We consider the channel model defined in \eqref{eq.:channelModel}.
%
The path loss is a urban macro (UMa) with non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and the shadowing is modeled as a log-normal distribution with standard deviation of $6$ dB \cite{AliZaidi632018}.
%
The noise power is modeled as $10\log_{10}(290 \cdot 1.38 \cdot 10^{-23} \cdot \Delta f \cdot 10^3 )$ dBm.
%

Tables~\ref{tab:la-sim-params} and \ref{tab:la-rl-params} list the simulation and \gls{ql-la} parameters.

% The main simulation parameters are listed in Table~\ref{tab:sim-params} and the parameters selected for the \gls{ql-la} are listed in Table \ref{tab:rl-params}.
Several combinations of the Q-Learning parameters $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ were tested and the combination that gives the best average throughput was kept.

\subsection{Baseline Solutions}

We assume as baseline solution a fixed lookup table scheme and a multi-antenna precoder selection that leads to maximum mean \gls{snr} defined in Eq. \eqref{eq.:snr}.

% We compare the \gls{ql-la} against a baseline solution, in which the \gls{mcs} selection is based on a \gls{amc} with a fixed look-up table \cite{fantacci2009adaptive} selection and it selects the multi-antenna precoder that results in the maximum mean \gls{snr} in Eq. \eqref{eq.:snr}.
%
In the fixed look-up table approach, a static mapping of the \gls{snr} to \gls{cqi} is obtained by analyzing the \gls{bler} curves and selecting the best \gls{mcs}, in terms of throughput, that satisfies the target \gls{bler} \cite{bruno2014robust}.
%
The process of analyzing the \gls{bler} curves gives the \gls{snr} thresholds that separate each \gls{cqi}.
%
We assumed a direct mapping of the \gls{cqi} to \gls{mcs}, i.e., each \gls{cqi} is mapped to one \gls{mcs}.
%
% Table \ref{tab:lookup} shows the \gls{cqi} to \gls{mcs} mapping, for a target \gls{bler} of $0.1$.
% %
% This table was obtained by analyzing the \gls{bler} curves in a \gls{awgn} channel.

\subsection{Experiment Description and Results}

% The experiment devised to assess the performance of the \gls{ql-la} in comparison to the baseline is composed of two phases, namely the training phase and deployment phase.
Our simulation has two phases: the training phase and the deployment phase. We use the first phase to train the agents to learn the environment dynamics while the second phase we use the knowledge acquired to make decisions, while comparing to the baseline.

\subsubsection{Training Phase}
% In the first phase, the \gls{rl} agents populates the Q-table to understand the environment.
%

Our simulation initializes with the \gls{ue} at a position with a radial distance of $35m$ of the \gls{bs} and goes away from the \gls{bs} in the opposite direction.
%
Then the \gls{ue} comes back to the center after reaching $160m$ from the \gls{bs}, and then it moves away again from the \gls{bs} to $160m$.
%
The simulation runs for a equivalent of $80s$ with the \gls{ue} speed equal to $20m/s$, this is equivalent to 8000 frames.
%
At the beginning of the transmission time, the channel has 10 paths and it changes after every $5m$ traveled, being either 1 (e.g. to emulate an environment change to LOS) or 10.

%
We use \gls{ql-la} with four configurations, as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Single agent solution with only the \gls{cqi} as state information.
    \item Single agent solution with the \gls{cqi} and \gls{ri} as state information.
    \item Multi-agent solution with only the \gls{cqi} as state information.

% We analyzed three \gls{ql-la} configurations, with a fixed transmission rank of one and two, therefore only selecting the \gls{pmi}s for these ranks, and a adaptive rank solution.

Table \ref{tab:la-train-results} reveals that the single-agent \gls{ql-la} shows a better performance in terms of throughput and \gls{tbler}, when compared to the multi-agent solution.
%
It also reveals the improvement of the \gls{ri} information to both architectures, providing an increase in both \gls{tbler} and throughput.
%
Figure \ref{fig:la-train-thr} shows the throughput averaged over a sliding window of 400 transmissions, during a total transmission time of 80 sec.

Figure \ref{fig:la-train-thr} shows that the single agent solution with \gls{ri} provides the highest peak rate, while maintaining an overall better performance.
%
Note that the single agent \gls{ql-la} scheme outperforms the multi-agent for almost the entirely of the simulation, although it has a worse beggining.

\subsubsection{Deployment phase}
The second phase uses the knowledge from the first phase, but with a $\epsilon$-greedy approach with a fixed value of $\epsilon = 0.05$, according to the minimum value of the $\epsilon$-decreasing in the training phase.
%
The goal is to have an assessment of how the \gls{rl} solution performs in the long run, in contrast to the first phase (Figure \ref{fig:la-train-thr}) that focus on the learning of the agents.
%

In this phase, we compare the \glspl{ql-la} with the baseline solution.
%
We perform $200$ Monte Carlo runs. At each run, the \gls{ue} starts at a random position between $35m$ and $60m$ of the \gls{bs}.
%
The \gls{ue} moves in a random rectilinear direction with a random speed between $10km/h$ and $20km/h$. Each simulation for a transmission time equivalent to $100ms$ which corresponds to 10 frames.
%
Similar for the previous experiment, at the beginning of the transmission time, the channel has 10 paths.
%
In the middle of the simulation time, the channel rank drops to 1 to emulate an environment change to LOS.
%

Table \ref{tab:la-deploy-results} shows the throughput and the \gls{tbler} of each \gls{ql-la} solution as well as the performance of the baseline solution.

%
The results reveal that the proposed single agent \gls{ql-la} scheme with \gls{ri} information yield a better performance in terms of throughput, while baseline solution shows a better performance in terms of \gls{tbler}.
%
It also reveals that the performance of the single agent solution without the \gls{ri} is close to the baseline and to the better solution, even though it has less information and needs less signaling.
%

We can note that baseline solution has a stable performance, with its values not varying much, while the single agent \gls{ql-la} provides the higher performances in terms of throughput, with its low values not too far from the baseline.

\section{Chapter Summary}
\label{sec:la-conclusion}
The \gls{rl} provides a self-exploratory framework that enables the \base~ to choose a suitable \gls{mcs} and multi-antenna precoding matrix that maximizes the throughput.
%
% Basically, the \gls{bs} decides a specific \gls{mcs} and \gls{pmi} at a certain time instant. And the \gls{bs}, in possession of the \gls{acknack} of the \gls{ue} calculates the performance of each agent.
%
In comparison to the baseline solution, consisting of a genie-aided precoder selection and a \gls{mcs} lookup table, our single agent \gls{ql-la} scheme with the \gls{ri} has a slightly better performance, while the single agent \gls{ql-la} without the \gls{ri} information presents a slightly worse performance.
%
The \gls{ql-la} with the \gls{ri} information already provides a reduce in signaling compared to the standard solution, due to the suppression of the \gls{pmi} information from the \gls{ue}, but this signaling can be reduced even more with the elimination of the \gls{ri} information, at the cost of small loss of performance.

The multi-agent \gls{ql-la} does not seem to provide a good mapping to this problem, as it performs worse than the baseline and the single agent solution.
%
While the \gls{ri} information improves the multi-agent solution, it is still not enough to make it usable.
%
A fine-tuning of our multi-agent \gls{ql-la} can be studied and may improve the result of this architecture.


% As a perspective of this work, we highlight the extension of the proposed \gls{rl}-based framework to include all the precoders of the standard \cite{3gpp.38.214} and the evaluation of a single \gls{rl} agent choosing both the \gls{mcs} and the \gls{pmi}.
% %
% Moreover, a comparison with other \gls{rl}-based algorithms such as multi-armed bandits (MABs) \cite{zhou2015survey} or deep RL solutions \cite{DeepRLSurvey} is envisioned.
%
% In addition, since \gls{nr} is a beam-based system, including the beam domain is another perspective.
% %
% In other words, our \gls{rl}-based solutions can also incorporate the selection of the best beam to transmit/receive data, among a set of choices (codebook).
% %
% These perspectives will be addressed in a follow-up work.
